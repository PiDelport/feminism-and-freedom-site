<script>
  $(function () {
    // Problem:
    // hugo-easy-gallery's load-photoswipe shortcode generates the PhotoSwipe overlay container
    // nested inside the page content, where it's limited by the surrounding stacking context,
    // which means that its z-index isn't enough to lift it above the theme's navigation elements.
    //
    // Hacky solution:
    // Reparent the PhotoSwipe overlay container to the outer body element on load.
    // This takes it out of the nested stacking context, and lets  it overlay the page navigation.
    //
    $('.pswp').appendTo('body');
