"The Haitian Revolution has often been described as the largest and most
successful slave rebellion in the Western Hemisphere. Slaves initiated the
rebellion in 1791 and by 1803 they had succeeded in ending not just slavery but
French control over the colony."[^1] On 1 January 1804, the Haitian Revolution
culminated in the birth of the world’s first republic that was led by former
slaves. "The Haitian Revolution, however, was much more complex, consisting of
several revolutions going on simultaneously."[^1] The complexity reflected the
social composition of Haitian society and the different competitive interests
over the control of the island. The French fought over Haiti and so did the
British and the Spanish. The majority of the population on the island was made
up of the African slaves. The rest were the “small whites”[^1] who were artisans
and hairdressers, “big whites” or the planter class that owned the agricultural
estates or plantations and the “mixed race” population known as the *mulatto*.
The series of events in Haiti were also "influenced by the French Revolution
of 1789, which would come to represent a new concept of human rights, universal
citizenship, and participation in government."[^1] In the course of the 13 years of
Haitian revolution, three different conceptions of freedom emerged. We shall
deal with these in turn.

### 1. Freedom from above - emancipation without property

The first conceptions of freedom emerged from above and specifically from the
French emissaries sent by the metropolitan colonial government to quell the
resistance of the slaves, recruit them to fight on the side of the French in
its competition with Spanish and British forces over the island. The two French
emissaries deployed on different parts of the island – Sonthonax in the North
and Polvorel in the South and West – had similar ideas about what freedom meant
for the slave population. Contained in both the French emissaries’ declarations
to end slavery in August and October 1793 were these conditions:

* The slaves would be freed but they would have no right to individually access
  the land for their own reproduction and livelihood.
* They still had to work on the plantation, under conditions that didn’t differ
  that much from the slave labour regime. This meant working from sunrise to
  sunset for 6 days a week with only 2 hours per week to work on their gardens.
  The only exception from work was on Sunday, which was considered a holiday
  across the colony.
* They could be free on Saturdays and one extra day, but only if they were
  willing to get lower wages. They would not be paid for these days
* The whip would be abolished and punishment for disciplinary offences was in
  the form of taking away a part of their wages.
* Imprisonment would be the punishment for those who chose not to work the land
* Under the Sonthonax declaration, the former slaves would receive 33% of the
  production earnings.
* Polverel was not as generous. Their wages would amount to 16% of the revenues
  of the plantation, with the rest going to the owners. If they chose to work
  for only four days a week, they would forfeit this. The owner would also be
  free to expel those who chose to work for four days a week.

For Polvorel, freedom did not mean individual or collective ownership of land
by the former slaves. In a letter he wrote to the former slave population on
the island, he was quick to say *“Africains, listen well. This land does not
belong to you. It belongs to those who purchased it or to their inheritors.”*

In both instances where slavery was abolished with declarations, freedom meant
that slave labour would be transformed to waged labour. This has led some
scholars to say that this form of freedom was intricately tied to their
exertion on the plantation. It was also a form of freedom without property
ownership. Under these conditions, the emancipated slaves were subjected to a
labour regime that too closely resembled that of slavery and this undermined
their efforts to reshape their lives as free individuals – according to their
needs and aspirations. The rights to liberty, property, security and resistance
to oppression were but a dream for the mass of former African slaves.

### 2. Freedom as plantation citizenship

The second conception of freedom emerged from the leadership of the slave
resistance. It was a combination of a conception from above but also reflected
sensibilities to the slave condition. Freedom meant the abolition of slavery
but not anything beyond this. Freedom did not include the extension of
individual liberties like ownership of property. The fate of the former slaves
would be tied up to the plantation. There were no prospects for social mobility
or freedom to move from one plantation to the next as a worker. There was no
residential mobility and strict punishment was meted out on those who broke the
rules. This type of freedom was at odds with the aspirations of the slave
population. It was a conception of freedom that was bound up with the need to
keep the plantations running, profitable and able to export to the
international market. This was important for safeguarding the colony from
imperialist powers. It was a form of plantation citizenship legitimised through
appeals to self-determination for the black race.

### 3. Freedom as self-ownership, independence from the plantation economy and ownership of land

The third conception of freedom emerged from the African slave population in
their hundreds of thousands. What did freedom mean to the slaves? Did it mean
emancipation and a formal end to the system of slavery? How did the slaves
shape their own conceptions of freedom from below?

The slaves defined their freedom in terms that highlighted their relationship
to the land, the labour regime on the plantation and their aspirations to
ultimately own what is produced from the land and enjoy the freedom to decide
what happens to the fruits of the land.

These aspirations were put into practice in a number of ways. Slaves expanded
‘kitchen gardens’ and annexed parts of the land that had been abandoned by the
French planter class. Under the laws of slavery, the kitchen gardens were
supposed to be used by the slave population for their nutritional needs and
nothing more than this. But the slaves found ways of expanding these gardens
and cultivate crops to sell at the market on Sundays. Some stole produce, crops
and commodities like coffee, sugar and syrup from different plantations and
sold these for their own profit at the market on the only day they were not
allowed to work. They often used transport belonging to the plantation owners
to move the goods from the plantations to the market.

The African workers on the plantation found all sorts of ways to evade the
backbreaking work at the plantation. They limited their days of work to five,
even if this meant a loss of wages. They went on go-slows, damaged the
sugar-cane and other crops and even absconded duty altogether. The slaves also
used abandoned plantations to build homes and establish families – something
that had been denied to them previously. They preferred to work their kitchen
gardens as this helped them to gain some individual independence from the
plantation and the strict labour regime that prevailed there.

Freedom was not only the absence of slavery, it was about creating the
conditions necessary for the former slaves to live meaningfully after their
emancipation. Self-sufficiency, independence, ownership of one’s self and body,
ownership of one’s labour and the fruits of that labour became defining
features of the slaves’ conception of freedom. They also fought for the right
to have 3 days to tend to their kitchen gardens – something that some scholars
have dismissed as a limited conception of freedom. But this demand had the
ability to change the relationship between the former slaves who were now
agricultural labourers and their former masters in radical ways. It would mean
that the ex-slaves had 4 days in total to themselves as Sunday had never been a
working day. This would translate to 60% of the week belonging to people who
had previously been only regarded as instruments of production and property
under the ownership of others. This conception of freedom included emancipation
and much much more.

## Conclusion

What this shows is that meanings of the words we have come to associate with
‘freedom’ – ‘liberty, citizenship, independence’ were not self-evident before
the start of the 13-year revolution. They were given concrete meaning in the
course of struggle and determined by the social forces on either side of the
rebellion.
