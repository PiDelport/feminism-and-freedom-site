This ground-breaking collection explores the profound power of Social Reproduction
Theory to deepen our understanding of everyday life under capitalism. While many
Marxists tend to focus on the productive economy, this book focuses on issues such
as child care, health care, education, family life and the roles of gender, race and
sexuality, all of which are central to understanding the relationship between
economic exploitation and social oppression. In this book, leading writers such as
Lise Vogel, Nancy Fraser, David McNally and Susan Ferguson reveal the ways in
which daily and generational reproductive labour, found in households, schools,
hospitals and prisons, also sustains the drive for accumulation.

*“At the heart of social reproduction theory is the question: ‘who produces the
worker?’ This question invites more questions: What kinds of processes enable the
worker to arrive at the doors of her place of work every day so that she can produce
the wealth of society? What role did breakfast play in her work-readiness? What
about a good night’s sleep? We get into even murkier waters if we extend the
questions to include processes lying outside this worker’s household. Does the
education she received at school also not “produce” her, in that it makes her
employable? What about the public transportation system that helped bring her to
work, or the public parks and libraries that provide recreation so that she can be
regenerated, again, to be able to come to work? These questions are the starting
point of social reproduction theory.”*

## What is Social Reproductive Theory?

Marxism teaches us that in the capitalist mode of production it is workers who
produce commodities and that is the beating heart of the system. But, social
reproduction theory asks the question that if workers produce commodities who
produces the worker?

So social reproduction theory is really about the social processes that produce
labour power as a commodity and how those social processes of the production of
labour power is connected to and imbricated with the social processes that produce
the commodity.

So if we say – let's say that the worker goes into her workplace at seven in the
morning and leaves her workplace at 5:00 p.m. in the afternoon then social
reproduction theory is the narrative of what happens before 7 a.m. and what
happens after 5p.m.

So to go back to the question of who produces the worker the first answer to this is
fairly obvious: that it is because the worker had a bed to sleep in and a house where
she had the bed and food to eat that her labour power was regenerated enough for
her to go back to work at 7 a.m. in the morning similarly, after 5:00 p.m. she came
home and that process starts again she also perhaps has support from friends or a
family who provides psychical support to her because she's had a rough day at work
perhaps for her to be able to go back the next morning so that is about social
reproduction taking place within the private sphere within the ambit of the family.

So that part of the answer is fairly straightforward the other subsection two the
answer of who produces the worker is social reproduction theory tells us that there is
a direct biological reproduction of the working class which happens within the family
through childbirth and that is one of the key ways in which the working class is
reproduced.

But of course, the reproduction of the working class within the family is not the only
way that the working class is reproduced.

The reproduction of the worker or labour power takes place in three senses:

1. Existing workers must be regenerated or maintained on a daily basis
2. That regeneration and maintenance must also be performed for non-workers
   – this includes children, the aged, the sick and frail, and other dependants.
3. New generations of workers must be born and nurtured to replace those who
   leave through illness, old age and death.

It takes *labour* to bring the labourer to the workplace door in a fit condition to produce
profits or perform capital’s and the state’s necessary tasks. Labour-power must be
*produced* and *reproduced*, in processes involving the application of human activity to
needed resources or means of reproduction.

## How Is SRT distinctive from wider feminist theory?

Before social reproduction theory, sort of emerged, many feminists did acknowledge
and did some wonderful creative work around privatized social reproduction,
domestic labor etc,

The work within the family was all really theorized and approached quite creatively
before social reproduction theory and many feminists actually think that the core of
social reproduction ends there within the family so it's the family that needs to be
studied and theorised.

But other social reproduction theorists – I count myself amongst them – see the core
of social reproduction theory much wider than the family.

Our work is also a critical engagement of Marx, who pays little attention to another
condition: *state intervention* into the conditions of reproduction of the working class.
In the course of the 20<sup>th</sup> century and the early parts of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the role of the
state in relation to the reproduction of the working class gained prominence. This
considerably widened the field for examination by social reproduction theory well
beyond the family-household – and called into question traditional approaches class
struggle and class politics. The conditions under which working class people rent
and purchase housing, the quality of urban life, transport, education, water and
sanitation, health and medicine, pensions, hours of work (and travel), the quality of
food, the supply of electric and gas power and fuel would, with many other issues,
come to play central parts in class struggles across the globe, requiring an *expanded*
notion of class struggle itself and of the social movements through which it is
conducted.

Public education and health care systems, leisure facilities in the community, and
pensions and benefits for the elderly all compose aspects of social reproduction

So for instance ‘how is the working class reproduced?’ is not just about the work
that's done within the family but what kind of access does this community have to
water? Think about Flint Michigan or Detroit where access to water was so violently
affected by the class and race dimensions of that part of the country.

What kind of public parks do the working-class children have access to? What kind
of health care system exists in this country that the working class can access?
So those public functions, those public socialized services are also crucial parts of
the reproduction of the working class. In this book, we try to think through these
various social relations – which are capitalist social relations that actually reproduce
the working class.

The real lesson for us to have written this book and I hope the real lesson for the
next generation of thinkers and activists who approach social reproduction theory is
that we understood that capitalism needs a stable set of social relations to reproduce
itself. *This includes the family and the labour that happens behind closed doors of
the family. But it is much more than that.*

There has to be certain kinds of work discipline, there has to be certain kinds of
political formations, that allow capitalism to do this. Social reproduction theory taught
us that at every moment that those social relations are forged by capitalism are also
moments for potential interruption of those social relations. So every battle for
housing, every battle for free access to health care, every battle for water, clean
water, can also take the shape of and certainly has the potential and the seed for a
wider anti-systemic struggle and that's the real lesson that I think we drew from
social reproduction theory and that we hope people will develop upon both in their
scholarship but also on the streets.
