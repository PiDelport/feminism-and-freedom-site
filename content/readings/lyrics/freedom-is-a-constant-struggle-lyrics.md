## Lyrics

They say that freedom is a constant struggle  
They say that freedom is a constant struggle  
They say that freedom is a constant struggle  
Oh Lord, we've struggled so long  
We must be free, we must be free  

They say that freedom is a constant crying  
They say that freedom is a constant crying  
They say that freedom is a constant crying  
Oh Lord, we've cried so long  
We must be free, we must be free  

They say that freedom is a constant sorrow  
They say that freedom is a constant sorrow  
They say that freedom is a constant sorrow  
Oh Lord, we've sorrowed so long  
We must be free, we must be free  

They say that freedom is a constant moaning  
They say that freedom is a constant moaning  
They say that freedom is a constant moaning  
Oh Lord, we've moaned so long  
We must be free, we must be free  

They say that freedom is a constant dying  
They say that freedom is a constant dying  
They say that freedom is a constant dying  
Oh Lord, we've died so long  
We must be free, we must be free
