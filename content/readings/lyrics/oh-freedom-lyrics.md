## Lyrics

Oh, freedom, Oh, freedom  
Oh freedom over me  
And before I'd be a slave  
I'd be buried in my grave  
And go home to my Lord and be free  
Oh, freedom  

Oh, freedom, Oh, freedom  
Oh freedom over me  
And before I'd be a slave  
I'd be buried in my grave  
And go home to my Lord and be free  
No more weepin', (don't you know), no more weepin'm  

No more weepin' over me  
And before I'd be a slave  
I'd be buried in my grave  
And go home to my Lord and be free  
Oh freedom  
Oh, freedomâ€¦
