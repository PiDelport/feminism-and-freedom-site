***2 hours***

# Aims

To help us to reflect on a selection of current perspectives
around feminism, as part of developing a common and shared
understanding and definition of feminism.

# About

There is little doubt that feminism has gained incredible
prominence over the recent period. In fact, it was the word of
the year for the globally renowned online dictionary,
Merriam-Webster in 2017!
So what is it? What are the core tenets defining feminism and is
it a worthy response in struggling for freedom?

# Task

Spend some time reading through the views/definitions below
and then discuss the questions that follow in <u>**small groups**</u>:

Please elect someone to report back to plenary.

## Perspective 1

Feminism can be broadly characterised by a concern with the
systematic disadvantage of womxn and the means through
which equitable outcomes can be achieved, it has never had
one distinct set of beliefs or a unified position.

## Perspective 2

Despite the variations between different types of feminist
approaches, there are four characteristics that are common to
the feminist perspective: (i) gender is a central focus, (ii) gender
relations are viewed as a problem: the site of social inequities,
strains, and contradictions, (iii) gender relations are not
unchallengeable: they are sociological and historical in nature,
subject to change and progress and (iv) feminism is about an
emancipatory commitment to change: the conditions of life that
are oppressive for women need to be transformed.

## Perspective 3

Feminism is a movement to end sexism, sexist exploitation, and
oppression.

## Perspective 4

[Intersectional feminism] is a form of feminism that aims to
include all women and recognises that race, gender identity,
sexual orientation, ability, and class all influence how much and
in what ways women are oppressed.

## Perspective 5

The term ‚Äúfeminism‚Äù suggests a single ideology, but in reality it
is a broad term for a variety of conceptions of the relations
between men and women in society. Due to historical
precedents, the current legal status of women in certain
countries and certain other factors, feminist ideology has been
compelled to move in different directions to achieve its goals. As
a result, there are many different kinds of feminisms. Essentially,
feminists question and challenge the origins of oppressive
gender relations and attempt to develop a variety of strategies
that might change these relations for the better.

## Perspective 6

Feminism is a movement which seeks to place women above
men and¬†trample¬†men into the dirt. Feminists will tell you that
their aim is to bring about equality, but equality¬†ceased¬†to be the
aim of feminism years ago. Women are now (and have been for
at least¬†5-10¬†years) given exactly the same treatment in every
area of life as men. Women / Feminists now wish to take over,
which is far from equality.

## Perspective 7

We need to reclaim feminism from those who use it as a political
tool; from those who use gender politics to hide their
true¬†motivations. Feminism needs to work for all of us. A
feminism that does not understand intersectionality, care about
working class issues, or distinguish between men being in
power and patriarchy, is not a feminism we need.

1. Do any of the views expressed above support your
   understanding of feminism? Please explain.

2. In light of your own experiences, the earlier discussions held
   and the perspectives presented above, develop your own
   definition or perspective of feminism.

3. Based on your group definition or perspective of feminism,
   draw a 3-legged stool that helps depict what you agreed to.
   (Below is a 3-legged stool illustrating a perspective on
   sustainability.)

Once your deliberations are over, prepare to present your 3-legged
stool on flip chart paper to the plenary.

***You have 45 minutes for the group work.***

The facilitator will <u>**synthesise**</u> your inputs, emerging with a
consolidated definition and an elaboration on feminism
today.
