## Aims

To help us to familiarise ourselves with the three commonly spoken
about phases, periods or waves of feminism that have formed part of
the history of the women‚Äôs movement, in order to to better understand
feminism today and what the future of feminism holds.

## About

The history of feminism is filled with radicals, progressives, liberals,
Marxists and centrists. It is filled with splinter movements,
counter-movements and conservative movements. That is part of what it means
to be both an intellectual tradition and a social movement, and right
now feminism is functioning as both with a vigor we haven‚Äôt seen in a
while.

One useful way of looking at the feminist movement is through what is
known as the waves metaphor. Despite its many critics, the waves of
feminism is a useful tool for understanding feminism today. It is a
useful way of linking the women‚Äôs movement of the ‚Äô60s and ‚Äô70s to the
women‚Äôs movement of the suffragettes. It is a useful way to describe
and distinguish between different eras and generations of feminism.
And it is useful in understanding some of complexity to the movement
through gender equality and a focus on the individual battles women
face.

Naturally, it is not a perfect metaphor. Some have argued that it's
historically misleading and not helpful politically, as it suggests that
gender activism has been for the most part unified around one set of
ideas, and that set of ideas can be called feminism. Others have called
it reductive, as it suggests that each wave of feminism is a monolith
with a single unified agenda, when in fact the history of feminism is a
history of different ideas in conflict. Others have critiqued its western,
northern centric analysis and its lack of an intersectional focus.

As Constance Grady (2018) indicated, it is however important to
recognise the enormous work that each wave has done for the feminist
movement, and to prepare to keep doing more work. If we want to
discard it, it is worth understanding first what we are discarding.

## Task 1

The facilitator will provide a brief plenary overview on the waves of
feminism, drawing on feminist theory as well as video clips from the All
About Women 2018 Conference. This overview will provide a broad
insight into the waves of feminism that will require some deeper
consideration in the next task.

***We will have 45 minutes for concluding task 1***

## Task 2

For this task you will be divided into 6 <u>**reading groups**</u> to explore a
particular wave in greater detail. Two groups will focus on each of the
waves, with one group looking at an international reading and the
second group at a South African reading.

You will have a roving resource person dedicated to your wave who
you can ask for advice/ questions or who can assist you with further
readings/information if required.

In your <u>**reading group**</u>, complete the two readings allocated to your
group, using the highlighters provided to highlight points that you
think are critical to consider or revisit.

On completing the readings, answer the following questions:

1. What did women during the wave you are looking at want?
   What freedoms were they denied?

2. What were their demands / slogans / popular imagery?

3. How did they organise? Who were the major players?

4. What did they win and how did this impact different groups of
   women?

5. What did they not address and what critiques did they face?

***You have 2 hours for the reading group. Please note that there
will not be an immediate report back on this. But do keep your
responses safe!***
