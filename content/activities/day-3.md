# About this day

The idea of freedom has played a major role in the history of political thought and
struggle. The idea has motivated many attempts at social change. Even so, across
different political traditions, there is no agreement about what freedom means. There
is also fierce contestation about ‘who’ should be free and how freedom comes about.
The boundaries of freedom are always shifting. There have been times when
freedom was synonymous with calls for formal legal and political equality, while at
other times freedom had more economic, social and personal dimensions. Our point
of departure today is Bernard Galle’s (1955) observation that some concepts are
“essentially contested” and freedom is one of those essentially contested concepts.

Definitions and meanings of freedom do not develop in a vacuum. They are part of
the contestations that take place between different groups in society. In these
meanings, there is a yearning to recover a lost past, to restore what has been lost or
taken away, and to make claims about the future.

In the process of challenging their subjugation, oppressed people have played a key
role in our understanding of freedom. In doing this, they have borrowed what they
deemed useful from different political traditions and from those who already enjoyed
freedom. The feminist tradition has played no small part in expanding the meaning of
freedom. It has done this by tackling dominant political traditions and pointing out
their blind-spots. Feminism has also developed new ideas of freedom which have
transformed how we think about what it means to be free.

# Objectives for this day

At the end of the day, participants should have an understanding of the different
meanings of freedom emerging from a range of political traditions, and how feminism
has grappled with the idea of freedom – giving us insights that are neglected in other
political traditions. The day is structured around the question: how (if at all) does
feminism gives us expanded notions of freedom?
