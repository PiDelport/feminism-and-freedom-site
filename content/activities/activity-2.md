***2 hours 15 minutes***

## Aims

Drawing upon your responses to the assignment between
modules, this activity aims to produce a conversation about the
state of freedom and women in South Africa today.

## About

In the local context women have wide ranging views on whether
they are free. These views are excavated in this activity in order
to assess where we stand on women’s freedom in South Africa
today.

## Task

Working in the **group** you were assigned to yesterday
(Wednesday afternoon), you will spend time consolidating your
work and deciding on how your group wishes to present their
findings.

You will need to ensure that your group presentation focuses on
the common themes, key words, and distinctive features of the
research each of you did through the interview task assigned.

Your presentation will connect to the visual items already
exhibited.

We will conclude this task with a plenary discussion on the
question ‘Are women free or unfree in South Africa today?’ and
the lesson learnt from the assignment and this exercise.
