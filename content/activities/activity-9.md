***2 hours 45 minutes***

# Aims

This task will help us to locate the concrete ways in which feminism
challenged, broadened and enriched ideas about freedom.

# About

There are quite a few ideas that are today associated with the feminist
tradition. Many of these ideas were responses to the neglect of feminist
concerns in existing ideas about freedom and in different struggles for
freedom. But feminism was not just a response to the blind-spots in
some of the dominant conceptions of freedom. It was also about
making a case for new visions of freedom. Now that we have looked at
four conceptions of freedom that emerged in different struggles, it is
time to look at where feminism stands in relation to these ideas and
how feminism gives us enriched ideas of freedom.

# Task

You will be divided into <u>**5 groups**</u>. Each group will receive a resource
pack with an article and images about the different ways in which
feminism has challenged and broadened ideas of freedom. Your task is
to carefully study the contents of the resource pack and prepare an
input that serves as a feminist ‚Äúbackchat‚Äù to the four conceptions of
freedom identified in the previous activity.

We suggest you follow these steps:

1. Start by reading the introduction to *The Feminist Challenge
Handout* and the specific section assigned to your group. Next,
Study the resource pack and discuss the question: ‚Äúwhat key ideas
about freedom does feminism bring to the fore?‚Äù

2. In the speech bubbles provided, write a response based on the key
ideas presented in your resource pack.

Get ready to report back to plenary.

**Group 5:**  <!-- TODO: Revisit? -->

Be mindful of the fact that participants in other groups were dealing
with different questions. They rely on you to present your case in a
succinct and clear manner, highlighting the key arguments and
insights that can be drawn from your case.

You have ***75 minutes*** for concluding steps 1 and 2 and we will
have ***45 minutes*** for the report back.

A ***45 minutes*** input that consolidates the presentations and a
discussion will conclude this session.

# üìñÔ∏è Handout: The Feminist Challenge

Over the years, the feminist tradition has engaged in a sustained conversation with
many of the ideas that are associated with what we call dominant conceptions of
freedom. This conversation takes place in the form of a dialogue and sometimes it
becomes similar to a community hall meeting, with many different voices in the room.
At different points in time, the feminist tradition ‚Äì with its different currents of thought
‚Äì had to tackle liberalism, Marxism, the anti-colonial tradition and much more. These
conversations are often robust, with the feminist tradition pointing out ‚Äòblind-spots‚Äô,
silences and exclusions in these traditions. The robust nature of these conversations
should not lead us to miss three important points:

1. These conversations and disagreements between feminism and other
traditions often take place in the course of struggle, in the heat of things.
This is important to underline as sometimes, those who are opposed to
feminism as a political project, dismiss it as an ‚Äúacademic exercise‚Äù.

2. The feminist tradition is not just engaged in the process of identifying
problems, important as this might be. There are novel and creative
interventions that feminism has introduced to how we think about freedom
today.

3.  The critique is sometimes not just directed at dominant conceptions of
freedom. There are fierce internal debates within the feminist tradition, and
most of these differences are around who exactly are the social layers
whose freedom we should fight for and what are the processes that shape
the experiences of women from different classes, geographies and races.

Some of the ideas about freedom that feminism has introduced include among
others social reproduction theory, the potent slogan ‚Äì ‚Äúthe personal is political‚Äù,
understandings of race that go beyond the masculine image of a revolutionary and
the refusal to allow national liberation movements to treat gender and women‚Äôs
oppression as an ‚Äúoptional extra‚Äù.

## Social Reproduction Theory

Social reproduction theory is a challenge that is directed at anti-capitalist
conceptions of freedom. These conceptions of freedom are criticised for their
pre-occupation with production and the exploitation of workers in the mines, factories
and farms to the neglect of an important question: *who reproduces the worker?* This
pre-occupation leads to the treatment of women‚Äôs oppression and the care work that
women perform in the home as an extension of capitalism‚Äôs functions. This explains
why many anti-capitalist conceptions of freedom argued that the inclusion of women
into waged work would free them from their subjugation. Feminists have persistently
argued that this is a superficial solution to the unfreedom of women caused by
reproductive labour. The washing of laundry, cooking, looking after children and the
elderly does not only benefit capitalists but men (husbands and fathers) too. It is
important to challenge men‚Äôs power and women‚Äôs subjugation in the home and
understand that this relationship of dominance and subjugation can live beyond
capitalism. New iterations of this challenge have broadened the scope even more by
including all the services that are required to reproduce the working class ‚Äì like
creches, schools, hospitals and clinics, parks, housing, water and electricity ‚Äì in this
definition of social reproduction.

## Personal is political!

Here we look at a popular slogan of the Second Wave which made the charge that
seemingly personal issues like getting an abortion, experiencing intimate partner
violence and doing back-breaking labour in the home, are not just personal problems
or individual issues but are related to how power is distributed in society. We also
look at how feminism challenged the idea that there are two separate spheres of life:
the private sphere and the public sphere. According to this separation, the public
sphere is a space for men to exercise political power and preside over political and
economic affairs. The private sphere is seen as a domain of women in the home and
the family where the rearing of children and caring for members of the family takes
place. Historically, the idea of separate sought to keep women in the home and away
from ‚Äúpublic affairs‚Äù like politics. It also called for the ‚Äúprivate sphere‚Äù, the family, to
be free from interventions from the state and other social institutions. Feminism
challenged this by arguing that decisions made in political affairs have a bearing on
women‚Äôs freedoms and that the home or family is not free of politics. Relationships in
the family are based on inequality, hierarchy and domination. Using the slogan
‚Äúpersonal is political‚Äù, feminists argued that the idea of a separate ‚Äúprivate sphere‚Äù
that is delinked from the rest of society is a liberal invention that is designed to
confine and isolate women‚Äôs oppression to ‚Äúprivate spaces‚Äù like the home and
relationships. It is an idea that seeks to delink the forms of oppression that women
experience in the family from their subordinate and subservient positions in the
workplace, economy and politics. Overall, the contribution of this challenge was to
politicise the home and the family and to redefine the ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù by arguing that
women‚Äôs experiences of patriarchy constitute political experiences.

## Race Matters, so does gender and class!

There is a vision of freedom that stems from a challenge to how some strands of
feminism neglected race and racism in their analysis. This vision of freedom is also a
challenge to the sexism within movements and organisations that stand for the
liberation of racially oppressed groups. It highlights the interconnectedness or
intersection of multiple forms of oppressions (race, class, gender, sexuality). In this
group, we look at how these contributions, emerging from the Black radical feminist
tradition, challenged and expanded notions of freedom. We use Robin D G Kelley‚Äôs
claim that Black radical feminism ‚Äì in engaging the ‚Äòblack freedom struggle‚Äô ‚Äì also
challenged the idea that oppressions based on sex and gender were the secondary
residue to racial capitalism and that they would eventually wither away with the
advent of black liberation. We look at how Black women took up struggles for
abortion rights and against forced sterilisation practices in ways that made their
experiences visible, valid and a solid platform against oppression.

## Women‚Äôs liberation is not a by-product of national liberation!

This challenge addresses two audiences. The first audience are feminists in the
global north who are reminded that their experience does not mirror the experiences
of all women and that, in the global south, the struggle for freedom from oppressive
gender relations is simultaneously a struggle against capitalism and colonialism.
Therefore, making claims for equality solely based on a gendered lens amounts to
competing to be equal to oppressed and colonised men. The second audience is
made up of men within the national liberation movement who often argued that
women‚Äôs liberation could either be postponed to sometime after the defeat of
capitalism, colonialism and imperialism, or it would be automatically delivered by the
‚Äúrevolution‚Äù. Women in the movements for independence had to constantly show
how women‚Äôs liberation is neither a diversion from national liberation nor can it be
postponed to some indefinite date. The women‚Äôs movements of the global south
insisted that women are not just a strategic social layer to be mobilised in struggle.
Women have experiences that are gendered and these experiences, alongside
experiences shaped by race and class, inform women‚Äôs participation in national
liberation politics.
