***2 hours 45 minutes***

# Aims

This task will help us to locate the concrete ways in which feminism
challenged, broadened and enriched ideas about freedom.

# About

There are quite a few ideas that are today associated with the feminist
tradition. Many of these ideas were responses to the neglect of feminist
concerns in existing ideas about freedom and in different struggles for
freedom. But feminism was not just a response to the blind-spots in
some of the dominant conceptions of freedom. It was also about
making a case for new visions of freedom. Now that we have looked at
four conceptions of freedom that emerged in different struggles, it is
time to look at where feminism stands in relation to these ideas and
how feminism gives us enriched ideas of freedom.

# Task

You will be divided into <u>**5 groups**</u>. Each group will receive a resource
pack with an article and images about the different ways in which
feminism has challenged and broadened ideas of freedom. Your task is
to carefully study the contents of the resource pack and prepare an
input that serves as a feminist “backchat” to the four conceptions of
freedom identified in the previous activity.

We suggest you follow these steps:

1. Start by reading the introduction to *The Feminist Challenge
Handout* and the specific section assigned to your group. Next,
Study the resource pack and discuss the question: “what key ideas
about freedom does feminism bring to the fore?”

2. In the speech bubbles provided, write a response based on the key
ideas presented in your resource pack.

Get ready to report back to plenary.
