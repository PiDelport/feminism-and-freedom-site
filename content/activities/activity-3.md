weight: 103

***3 hours***

# Aims

<!-- XXX: Reference to Module 1 -->
This activity will help us to recap our work from Module 1
(_Contemporary Challenges to Freedom_) on analysing the
structure of paragraphs and provide a bridge to this module
(_Feminism and Freedom_) by discussing components of an
argument which are (a) claims (b) assumptions (c) evidence (d)
conclusions.

# About

The ability to recognise and evaluate an argument is a critical
skill in today‚Äôs activist world. In many ways, we are confronted
with arguments about issues that are close to our hearts as
activists on a daily basis. Whether it is a radio call-in or in the
opinion section of the newspaper, arguments about issues as
varied as migration, reproductive rights and violence in our
schools are being presented in different ways, in formal and
informal spaces. But, what do we mean by ‚Äúargument‚Äù? What
are the necessary components of an argument and how do we
evaluate a good or bad argument?

# Task

You will be divided into <u>**6 groups**</u>. Each group will read the
Peter Beinart article *The new authoritarians are waging a war on
women* from The Atlantic Jan/Feb 2019.

In your groups prepare a presentation to plenary that covers the
following:

1. What is the main argument?

2. What is the evidence provided to support it?

3. What questions or criticisms do you have about the strength
of the argument?

4. What are the gaps or silences in the article? Is there any
counter-evidence that could be provided?

**You have 45 minutes for this task.**

Record the responses on poster cards and get ready to present
to the rest of the class.

The facilitator will wrap this discussion up with a quick
presentation.
