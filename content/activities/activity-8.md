## Aims

This activity will look at three conceptions of freedom and the key ideas
that each conception brings to the fore.

## About

Different ideas about freedom have developed over time. Each
conception of freedom tells us something about society at a particular
point in time, its contestations and struggles. With this activity, we look
at four conceptions of freedom that emerge out of different struggles.
These conceptions of freedoms are:

* freedom as political rights and equality
* freedom with social and economic dimensions
* freedom as emancipation from slavery
* freedom as independence from colonial rule

## Task

Working in <u>**4 groups**</u>, you will be provided with one of the four
'[Freedom Declarations]'. These declarations outline visions of freedom
as well as the struggles that brought these conceptions of freedom to
the fore.

[Freedom Declarations]: {{< relref "readings/four-conceptions-of-freedom" >}}

In your group, carefully read the Freedom Declaration you have been
allocated and then answer the following questions:

1. What are the key ideas put forward in your freedom declaration?

2. Where do these ideas come from?

3. What would a feminist response/question be to your particular
conception of freedom?

Once you have concluded the questions, package your responses
in the form of a charter. Your charter must include a preamble.

Please refer to the handout for an example of a workers’ charter.

***You will have 1 hour to conclude this group work and 30
minutes for the report back.***

The facilitator will wrap up this activity with a ***45 minutes
<u>presentation</u>*** on the four conceptions of freedom and their origins
and linking the presentation to the charters produced.
