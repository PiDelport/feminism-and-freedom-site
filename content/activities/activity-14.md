This session will be an evaluation of the course, conducted by Professor Linda
Cooper of UCT. Professor Cooper, who has a long history in adult and worker
education, has been asked to gauge participants experience of the course, and to
share her own perspective on the content and teaching of the module. The purpose
of this evaluation is for participants to be able to share their experiences and
perspectives, and for Tshisimani staff to be able to learn from this experience and
improve our teaching and educational programmes.
