# Aims

<!-- XXX: Reference to Module 1 -->
Linking to Module 1 _(Contemporary Challenges to Freedom)_,
this activity will help us to highlight the erosion of women’s
freedoms around the world through authoritarianism, technology
and inequality by investigating a series of case studies.

# About

Around the world an erosion of women’s personal freedoms has
begun. Globally, there is a debate about whether what we see is
a backlash against hard-won gains or the unravelling of partial
democracies. Those who speak of a backlash borrow
extensively from Susan Faludi who in 1991, identified a
backlash as *“a counterassault on women’s rights… an attempt to
retract the handful of small and hard-won victories that the
feminist movement did manage to achieve for women”*. In this
activity, we use this concept as springboard for understanding
the position of women in a world losing freedoms through
authoritarianism, inequality and technology. This activity uses
recent case studies to assess the position of women and the
LGBTIQ community in society today.

# Task

Working in seven <u>**small groups**</u>, you are tasked with studying a
case study detailing a global example of an erosion of women’s
freedoms.

1.  Having studied your case study, use the sticky notes
    provided to list the freedoms which are being eroded in your
    case.

2.  Next, using the details from the case study and the visual
    resources provided, prepare to present a summary and
    display of your case study example to the rest of the group.
    Your presentation should not be more than 3-5 minutes.

    Remember, the other groups are not familiar with your case
    study. You have ***45 minutes*** for the group work.

3.  Once you have completed your display, return to the
    teaching room for a plenary where you will refer to the world
    map provided, placing your sticky notes at the demarcated
    flag and country. We will then discuss the dominant trends
    around the world, answering the following questions:

    * Based on your case studies what are the particular
      experiences of women in the world today?

    * What is noticeable about women’s freedoms today in the
      global context?

    The facilitator will draw together this discussion, by
    consolidating the dominant trends and what this means for
    women’s freedom today.
