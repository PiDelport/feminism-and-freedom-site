***1 hours 30 minutes***

# Aims

Using songs, poems and slogans about freedom, this activity will help
us to make the link between the idea of freedom and struggles for
social change.

# About

The idea of freedom has been invoked historically by different layers of
society. It appears in political speeches, songs, slogans and poems
that define different eras and struggles. Sometimes, it has been
invoked by those in power to justify their rule. Many times, it is taken up
by the oppressed in their efforts to challenge their oppression. The
meaning of freedom is always shifting and changing. The meanings
can range from restoring what has been lost to questioning an unjust
order and making claims about the future.

# Task

For this task you will be divided into <u>**4 groups**</u>. Each group will listen to
(and watch) a song from a particular era of struggle. On a set of
flashcards provided to your group, write your responses to these
questions:

1. What is the relationship between the idea of freedom and struggles
for social change?

2. Write down your responses on the flashcards provided and be
prepared to compare your flashcards with those of the other groups.

You have ***50 minutes*** for this task.

We will conclude this session with a ***40 minutes*** plenary
presentation, consolidating the ideas of freedom generated through
the group work.
