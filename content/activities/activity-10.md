## Overview

In this fireside chat, we set the context for feminist concerns in international women’s
movements, including feminist socialism within the 2ⁿᵈ international in the following
ways:

1. Comparing and contrasting the priorities of the liberal/progressive (bourgeois)
movements up to 1914, looking at the socialist critique of bourgeois women’s
movements as well as internal discussion of the woman question in German
social democracy (Zetkin, Bebel).

2. Looking at responses to WW1 in the international women’s movements,
especially focusing on women who maintained international links during the
war. Here we would look at the 5 women’s congresses that took place
between 1914 and 1919. The Hague and Berne in 1915, Stockholm in 1917
and Berne and Zurich in 1919.

3. Women and the revolution. Here we offer a brief history of revolutionary
unrest post 1914, concentrating on the revolutionary unrest that led to regime
change in Germany, Austria and Hungary and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian
and German empires after 1918. We outline women’s roles in the
revolution and look at the overlap between the ideas and aims of socialist
women within party structures, and women working outside these structures
who put forward socialist visions for the new world order.
