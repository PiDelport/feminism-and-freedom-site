## Aims

To help us to consolidate our work from earlier by building a huge
poster of the wave your reading group explored.

## About

Poster making is a fun and creative way for us to share our learnings
with each other.

## Task

Firstly, you will need to find the other group that was working on the
same wave as you were. As a <u>**combined group**</u> you will need to
produce a poster, using the materials provided by the facilitator, as well
as your own creativity, to illustrate the wave you had been reading
about.

For the wave you are working on, your poster must include:

* The freedoms denied during this wave
* The demands/claims for freedom of this wave
* The slogans and popular imagery used
* The victories and achievements as well as the challenges for feminists/ism
* The blind spots, silences and critiques faced by feminist of this wave

Be creative! But don‚Äôt lose the answers to the questions you were
tasked with.

Be ready to present your posters in the morning. You will have
between ***10-15 minutes for the presentation*** of your poster, which will
be followed by critical feedback from the resource person that was
allocated to your group.
