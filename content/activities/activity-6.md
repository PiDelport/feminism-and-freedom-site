***1 hour***

# Aims

To help us to consolidate our work from earlier by building a huge
poster of the wave your reading group explored.

# About

Poster making is a fun and creative way for us to share our learnings
with each other.

# Task

Firstly, you will need to find the other group that was working on the
same wave as you were. As a <u>**combined group**</u> you will need to
produce a poster, using the materials provided by the facilitator, as well
as your own creativity, to illustrate the wave you had been reading
about.

For the wave you are working on, your poster must include:

* The freedoms denied during this wave
* The demands/claims for freedom of this wave
* The slogans and popular imagery used
* The victories and achievements as well as the challenges for feminists/ism
* The blind spots, silences and critiques faced by feminist of this wave

Be creative! But don‚Äôt lose the answers to the questions you were
tasked with.

Be ready to present your posters in the morning. You will have
between ***10-15 minutes for the presentation*** of your poster, which will
be followed by critical feedback from the resource person that was
allocated to your group.

# üìñÔ∏è Handout: Waves of Feminism

Some would argue that one of the [greatest challenges] to understanding
feminism may be the fact that the ideology and philosophy informing it have shifted
over time. Others will argue that we cannot speak of feminism but should instead
speak of feminisms. While others will have us understand feminism through
typologies of political conceptions. There are many ways in understanding how
feminism has developed over time ‚Äì we have chosen to introduce here the creation
of separate [‚Äúwaves‚Äù of feminism].

Over time, feminist activists have campaigned for issues such as women‚Äôs legal
rights, especially in regard to contracts, property, and voting; body integrity and
autonomy; abortion and reproductive rights, including contraception and prenatal
care; protection from domestic violence, sexual harassment, and rape; workplace
rights, including maternity leave, child care and equal pay; and against all other
forms of discrimination women encounter. It is common in feminist history and
theory to speak of three waves of feminism. However, there is little consensus as to
how to characterise these three waves or how to categorise women's movements
before the late nineteenth century. Similarly, there has been critiques of the northern
centricity of the waves metaphor and its inability to see the world beyond a gendered
binary, among others.

The first wave, occurring in the 19th and early 20th century, was mainly concerned
with women‚Äôs right to vote. The second wave, at its height in the 1960s and 1970s,
refers to the women‚Äôs liberation movement for equal legal and social rights. The third
wave, beginning in the 1990s, refers to a continuation of, and a reaction to, second-wave
feminism. There is also an emerging [fourth wave] of feminism that is less
universally recognised and which focuses on technology.

## The first wave: 1800‚Äôs ‚Äì early 1900‚Äôs

First-wave feminism most often refers to an extended period of feminist activity
during the nineteenth century and early twentieth century in the United Kingdom and
the United States.

During the 1800s [women] had little control over their lives. The average married
female gave birth to seven children. Higher education was off-limits. Wealthier
women could exercise limited authority in the domestic sphere but possessed no
property rights or economic autonomy. Lower-class women toiled alongside men, but
the same social and legal restrictions applied to them as well. At the same time
there were many social changes as a result of industrialisation, national expansion
and discussions on individuals‚Äô rights.

[women]: https://people.howstuffworks.com/women.htm

The issue of slavery drew many women into the public sphere and in the early
1800s, women were instrumental in organising and participating in the Abolition
Movement. Angelina and Sarah Grimke became well-known abolitionists who defied
social custom by publicly addressing the American Anti-Slavery Society. In response
to the fierce criticism of their speech, Sarah Grimke penned "Letters on the Equality
of the Sexes" in 1838.

While the first wavers initially focused on the promotion of equal contract and
property rights for women and the opposition to chattel marriage and ownership of
married women (and their children) by their husbands, by the end of the nineteenth
century, their activism focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the
right of women's suffrage. Yet, feminists such as Voltairine de Cleyre and Margaret
Sanger were still active in campaigning for women's sexual, reproductive, and
economic rights at this time. In 1854, Florence Nightingale established female
nurses as adjuncts to the military.

The campaign for women‚Äôs suffrage which emerged in the 1840s and 1850s fought
against the subordination and exploitation of women. The women‚Äôs suffrage
movement was in alignment with the Black Suffrage and the Abolitionist movement,
they were deeply intertwined, sharing similar goals of equality. Often, supporters of
one cause were devoted to the other as well. Many feminists at the time were
therefor not only [suffragists], but also [abolitionists]. Though the connection was
difficult to form at first, black and white women eventually formed strong bonds in the
early 20th century. A common goal of equality for all women, regardless of race, was
established. [Estelle Freedman] discusses the issue of race in early feminism in her
book, *[No Turning Back: The History of Feminism and the Future of Women]*.

When denied the right to speak and visibly participate at anti-slavery and
temperance conventions, women reformers organised the first women‚Äôs rights
convention. The 300 attendee strong Seneca Falls Women‚Äôs Rights Convention,
held on the 14 July 1848, was organised by abolitionists Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth
Cady Stanton and focused on multiple issues, including education rights, property
reforms, and women‚Äôs restrictive roles within the family. It also famously gave voice
to the now-famous activists like the African-American Sojourner Truth (d. 1883), who
demanded: "Ain't I a woman?" The convention attendees drew up a Declaration of
Sentiments, which detailed how men had denied women their rights. It was only after
much deliberation that the 300 attendees decided also to address the controversial
issue of women‚Äôs suffrage. The press responded disdainfully to the convention, but
the event laid the groundwork for the suffrage movement. Other prominent leaders,
including Susan B. Anthony, Sojourner Truth and Lucy Stone (known for the
unthinkable act of retaining her surname after marriage), joined the suffrage ranks as
well.

Early first-wave feminists were liberal ‚Äì naturalistic, feminists for whom the pressing
socio-political agenda was centered around suffrage for women. Victorian America
saw women acting in very "un-ladylike" ways (public speaking, demonstrating, stints
in jail), which challenged the "cult of domesticity." Some have argued that their key
project was an individualist and reformist attack to dismantle discriminatory laws and
gender- based exclusionary social norms ‚Äì being primarily concerned with
establishing in policy that women are human beings in their own right and not the
property of men. While others have framed this as the realisation among women
that they must first gain political power (including the right to vote) to bring about
change particular in the spheres of sexual, reproductive and economic matters.
Either way, the seed was planted that women have the potential to contribute just as
much if not more than men.

While strongly influenced by Quaker thought, American first-wave feminism involved
a wide range of women. Some, such as Frances Willard, belonged to conservative
Christian groups such as the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Others, such
as Matilda Joslyn Gage, were more radical, and expressed themselves within the
National Woman Suffrage Association or individually. American first-wave feminism
is considered to have ended with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the
United States Constitution (1919), granting women voting rights.

The achievement of female suffrage in most Western countries in the early twentieth
century meant that the campaign for legal and civil rights assumed a lower profile
and deprived the women's movement of a unifying focus. In addition, the movement
was seen as being populated mostly by white upper- and middle-class women.

By the 1950s, despite the traditional images of women, more and more middle-class
white women were entering the labour market, and single motherhood and divorce
rates were beginning to rise. The strain between societal expectations of domesticity
and women‚Äôs experiences in education and the workforce, along with other factors
such as the rise of the cycle of new social movements that swept the United States
and Western Europe, led to the re-emergence of the movement in the 1960s and
1970s.

## The second wave: 1960‚Äôs-1980‚Äôs

The second wave began in the 1960s and continued into the 90s. Building on the
first wavers, this wave unfolded in the context of the anti-war and civil rights
movements and the growing self-consciousness of a variety of minority groups
around the world. The New Left was on the rise, and the voice of the second wave
was increasingly radical and revolutionary, centred around the demands of the
growing Women's Liberation Movement. Second-wave feminists challenged
prevailing notions of the women‚Äôs role in the family, workplace, and society ‚Äì
addressing diverse issues such as childcare, equal pay, employment and education
opportunities, reproductive rights, and women and children‚Äôs safety. Sexuality and
reproductive rights were dominant issues, and much of the movement's energy was
focused on social equality regardless of sex. They highlighted the sexual division of
labour and were instrumental in promoting women‚Äôs equality in the labour market.

Some argue that this wave began with protests against the Miss America pageant in
Atlantic City in 1968 and 1969. Feminists parodied what they held to be a degrading
"cattle parade" that reduced women to objects of beauty dominated by a patriarchy
that sought to keep them in the home or in dull, low-paying jobs. The radical New
York group called the Redstockings staged a counter pageant in which they crowned
a sheep as Miss America and threw "oppressive" feminine artifacts such as bras,
girdles, high-heels, makeup and false eyelashes into the trashcan.

Because the second wave of feminism found voice amid so many other social
movements, it was easily marginalised and viewed as less pressing than, for
example, Black Power or efforts to end the war in Vietnam. Feminists reacted by
forming women-only organisations (such as the National Organization for Women,
NOW) and "consciousness raising" groups. In publications like "The BITCH
Manifesto" and "Sisterhood is Powerful," feminists advocated for their place. The
second wave was increasingly theoretical, based on a fusion of neo-Marxism and
psycho-analytical theory, and began to associate the subjugation of women with
broader critiques of patriarchy, capitalism, normative heterosexuality, and woman's
roles as wife and mother. Sex and gender were differentiated‚Äîthe former being
biological, and the later a social construct that varies culture-to-culture and over time.

Whereas the first wave of feminism was generally propelled by middle class,
Western, cisgender, white women, the second phase drew in women of color and
developing nations, seeking sisterhood and solidarity, claiming "Women's struggle is
class struggle." In contrast to the first-wavers, the movement benefited from the
involvement of far more organisations, encompassing a broad spectrum of political
beliefs and ideologies, taking on many forms and included the Black Civil Rights
Movement, Anti Vietnam Movement, Chicano Rights Movement, Asian-American
Civil Rights Movement, Gay and Lesbian Movement and many other groups fighting
for equality. Feminists spoke of women as a social class and coined phrases such
as "the personal is political" which became synonymous with the second wave, in an
effort to demonstrate that race, class, and gender oppression are all related. They
initiated a concentrated effort to rid society top-to-bottom of sexism, from children's
cartoons to the highest levels of government.

In addition, the publication of books such as Simone de Beauvoir‚Äôs *The Second Sex*
in 1952 and Betty Friedan‚Äôs *The Feminine Mystique* in 1962 sparked primarily white
middle-class women‚Äôs dissatisfaction with the roles of men and women. And while
heavily critiqued, both provided contributions to this wave. De Beauvoir‚Äôs *The
Second Sex* provided a detailed analysis of women's oppression and is seen as a
foundational tract of contemporary feminism. Her famous "one is not born a woman,
but becomes one" focuses on the social construction of Woman as the Other,
viewing this as fundamental to women's oppression. Friedan‚Äôs *The Feminine
Mystique* criticised the idea that women could find fulfillment only through
childrearing and homemaking, causing women to lose their own identities in that of
their family. According to Friedan‚Äôs *New York Times* obituary, her book ‚Äúignited the
contemporary women‚Äôs movement in 1963 and as a result permanently transformed
the social fabric of the United States and countries around the world‚Äù.

From 1972 to 1982, the second wave was in what has been characterised as its
heyday. Women‚Äôs liberation groups continued to recruit women to feminism and
caused cultural shock waves with their critiques of femininity, gender roles, and
heterosexuality. Issues of rape, domestic violence, abortion and access to childcare
came to the forefront of the feminist platforms. Through consciousness-raising,
women could identify common struggles and receive support while feminism grew
into a mass movement. From this form of engagement, the slogan "the personal is
political" aptly summed up the goals of second-wave feminism. What were once
private issues were now in the public realm. In the US women‚Äôs rights groups won
legislative victories with the 1972 passage of Title IX directed at ending sex
discrimination in publicly funded education and the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision by
the Supreme Court legalising abortion. One result of this heightened activity in the
United States and abroad was that in 1975 the United Nations sponsored the First
International Conference on Women in Mexico City.

Although these years were times of success for feminists, it was also a period of
conflict, fragmentation, and growing discord in the movement. Critical second wave
feminists moved away from many of the ideas espoused by liberal feminists,
particularly those relating to working within the capitalist status quo. Lesbians,
working-class women, and women of color critiqued white middle-class women‚Äôs
control of both branches of the movement. Informed by the discord in the first and
second waves, feminists and feminist scholars, such as the Combahee River
Collective and, later, Patricia Hill Collins, conceptualised an intersectional feminist
paradigm that views race/ethnicity, class, gender, and sexuality as interlocking
systems of oppression, forming a‚Äù matrix of domination.‚Äù Black feminist writer bell
hooks dismissed the idea of a common oppression among women arguing that
leading white feminists in the 1970s only reinstated classist white supremacy by not
acknowledging the experience of being a black woman.

Indeed, some feminist organisations at that time came across barriers to integrating
white and black members. Gloria Steinem and other white feminists strived
unsuccessfully to coordinate a racially diverse board of the Women's Action Alliance
in 1971. Some black feminists felt marginalised in certain groups and banded
together. In 1973, as a result, the National Black Feminist Organization was founded.

Could the movement recover from all of these fractures and produce a third wave of
feminism?

## The third wave: 1990‚Äôs ‚Äì early 2000‚Äôs

At the end of the second wave, the popular media and some political pundits
repeatedly declared feminism dead or in decline. Scholars and activists responded to
these obituaries in different ways. Some argued that these ‚Äúpremature‚Äù death notices
serve a larger goal, preserving the status quo by erasing women‚Äôs activism. Some
argued that feminism diffused into the larger culture, bringing about a ‚Äúpost-feminist‚Äù
era where feminist goals and ideology are alive but submerged into the broader
culture. Others viewed the movement as fragmented, particularly because of issues
of homophobia, classism, and racism, yet insisted that it still remained active and
vital. Related to this view, others argued that feminism had changed form and was
now done in a different way by a new generation of activists.

Adopting the view that the movement had changed form and tactics, some scholars
and participants referred to this phase of the women‚Äôs movement as ‚Äúthe third wave.‚Äù
The idea of a third wave comes from the concept of a political generation, a period
when common historical experiences form a political frame of reference for a group.

Originating in the 1980s, third-wave feminism began in the early 1990s, arising as a
response to perceived failures of the second wave and also as a response to the
backlash against initiatives and movements created by the second wave. Some
argue that the third wave began with the 1991 Clarence Thomas Supreme Court
confirmation hearings. The proceedings attracted widespread national attention
when Anita Hill alleged sexual harassment by Thomas and witnesses corroborated
her claims. Thomas' eventual confirmation enraged and re-energised feminists
across the country; in 1992, a record number of women won national political office.
Rebecca Walker's essay, "Becoming the Third Wave," published in the January 1992
edition of Ms. magazine, voiced this feminist revival.

Third-wave feminism seeks to challenge or avoid what it deems to be the second
wave's essentialist definitions of femininity, with an over-emphasis on the
experiences of upper middle-class white women. In this phase many constructs were
destabilised, including the notions of "universal womanhood," body, gender,
sexuality and heteronormativity. The third-wave sees women‚Äôs lives as
intersectional, demonstrating how race, ethnicity, class, religion, gender, and
nationality are all significant factors when discussing feminism. It examines issues
related to women‚Äôs lives on an international basis. It tackles body image,
transgender sexuality and sweatshop labour along with reproductive freedom,
workplace equality and violence against women. An aspect of third wave feminism
that mystified the mothers of the earlier feminist movement was the readoption by
young feminists of the very lip-stick, high-heels, and cleavage proudly exposed by
low cut necklines that the first two phases of the movement identified with male
oppression. Pinkfloor expressed this new position when she said that it is possible to
have a push-up bra and a brain at the same time.

This wave is also about acceptance and a deeper understanding of the term
‚Äòfeminism‚Äô, due to varying feminist outlooks. There are ego-cultural feminists, the
radicals, the liberal/reforms, the electoral, academic, ecofeminists‚Ä¶ the list goes on.
Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave like Gloria Anzaldua, bell hooks, Chela
Sandoval, Cherrie Moraga, Audre Lorde, Maxine Hong Kingston, and many other
black feminists, sought to negotiate a space within feminist thought for consideration
of race-related subjectivities. Third-wave feminism also contains internal debates
between difference feminists such as the psychologist Carol Gilligan (who believes
that there are important differences between the sexes) and those who believe that
there are no inherent differences between the sexes and contend that gender roles
are due to social conditioning. At the same time, for third wavers, struggles are more
individual: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need feminism anymore.‚Äù

Third wave feminism breaks boundaries. The "grrls" of the third wave stepped onto
the stage as strong and empowered, eschewing victimisation and defining feminine
beauty for themselves as subjects, not as objects of a sexist patriarchy. They
developed a rhetoric of mimicry, which appropriated derogatory terms like "slut" and
"bitch" in order to subvert sexist culture and deprive it of verbal weapons. The web is
an important tool of "girlie feminism." E-zines have provided "cybergrrls" and
"netgrrls" another kind of women-only space. Grrl-feminism tends to be global, multi-
cultural, and it shuns simple answers or artificial categories of identity, gender, and
sexuality. Its transversal politics means that differences such as those of ethnicity,
class, sexual orientation, etc. are celebrated and recognised as dynamic, situational,
and provisional.

## The fourth wave?

Many have written about how a fourth wave of feminism is in the air. The fourth wave
is still a captivating silhouette. As one US writer points out, ‚ÄúA few months ago, a
high school student approached one of the staff of the Center for Gender Equity at
Pacific University and revealed in a somewhat confessional tone, ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm a
feminist!‚Äù It was like she was coming out of the closet. Well, perhaps that is the way
to view the fourth wave of feminism.‚Äù

[Center for Gender Equity]: https://www.pacificu.edu/about-us/centers/center-gender-equity

The fourth wave of feminism is emerging because (mostly) young women realise that
the third wave is either overly optimistic or hampered by blinders. Feminism is now
moving from the academy and back into the realm of public discourse. Issues that
were central to the earliest phases of the women‚Äôs movement are receiving national
and international attention by mainstream press and politicians: problems like sexual
abuse, rape, violence against women, unequal pay, slut-shaming, the pressure on
women to conform to a single and unrealistic body-type and the realisation that gains
in female representation in politics and business, for example, are very slight.

The emerging fourth wavers are not just reincarnations of their second wave
grandmothers; they bring to the discussion important perspectives taught by third
wave feminism. They speak in terms of intersectionality whereby women‚Äôs
suppression can only fully be understood in a context of the marginalisation of other
groups and genders‚Äîfeminism is part of a larger consciousness of oppression along
with racism, ageism, classism, ableism, and sexual orientation.

The expressions of many feminisms, not just one ideology, and the recognition that
there have always been tensions, points and counter-points is centered. The
political, social and intellectual feminist movements have always been chaotic,
espousing multiple values, meanings, or appeals: there must be hope that they
continue to be so, it is a sign that they are thriving.

Will the fourth wave fully materialise and in what direction?
