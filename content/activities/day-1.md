## About this day

Globally, there is a debate about the state of freedoms for women and the
LGBTQ+ community. Two different perspectives have gained prominence in
this debate. On the one hand are those who argue that the world is witnessing
a global backlash against women’s freedoms and the freedoms of the
LGBTQ+ community. Those who hold this view see the resurgence of
patriarchal ideology, emphasis on the ‘natural order of the world’, family
values, legislative steps to reverse the right to abortion, gendered violence
and escalating insecurity inaugurated by economic policies that promoted the
withdrawal of the state from providing social services, as indicative of this
backlash. The global authoritarian turn in places like Brazil and the United
States, and the weaponisation of technology to clamp down on activists and
their movements, is seen as part of this backlash.

On the other hand, there are activists who caution against the reference to the
‘backlash’ in general terms, especially since some of the freedoms that are
being eroded in places like the United States, are still to be realised
elsewhere. For this view, the status of women and the LGBTQ+ community
points to the reality of what it means to be living, struggling and resisting in
what has been called illiberal or partial democracies.

While these may appear like sharp differences, many feminists agree that
there is a need to resist erosions to freedom, fight against the deliberate
shrinking of spaces for freedom and to strengthen the efforts of those who are
struggling for a breakthrough under various authoritarian regimes.

## Objectives for this day

At the end of the day, participants will have an understanding of the state of
